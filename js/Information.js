The Port of Vancouver, a world-class port situated on Burrard Inlet, is one of the busiest in North America. The port situates Vancouver as Canada's gateway to Asia.

        description2: "People have lived in the Beijing area for thousands of years. Several towns were built on the site and later destroyed. In the 1200s the Mongol leader Kublai Khan built the city of Dadu on the site. He made Dadu the capital of China. Except for a few brief periods, the city has been China’s capital ever since.The city was renamed Beijing in the early 1400s. It was known as Peking in the United States and other Western countries until the early 1980s. “Beijing” is now the official way to write the city’s name in English. In the 1980s and ’90s, three of Beijing’s historical areas—the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, and the Temple of Heaven—were named World Heritage sites by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). At the same time many new apartment buildings, shopping centers, and office buildings gave the city a new look. Some of the new buildings were constructed for the 2008 Summer Olympics, which Beijing hosted. Population (2014 estimate), urban area, 19,520,000.",

        description2: "The history of Jakarta dates back to at least the 14th Century with the development of a small port of the Hindu Pajajaran kingdom at the mouth of the Ciliwung river. Searching for the fabled spice islands, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive and establish a fortress on the site in the early 16th Century. The old port was attacked by a neighboring sultanate under the leadership of Prince Fatahillah. After the assault, the Portuguese navy fleet was destroyed. Fatahillah changed the name of the Sunda Kelapa port to Jayakarta, meaning “Total Victory”. It was to this town that Dutch spice merchants came in the late 16th Century and began a trading association with Europe that was to dictate the history of Jakarta, and Indonesia as a nation, for nearly 350 years. Under the Dutch East India Company (VOC) the town of Jayakarta was renamed to Batavia in 1619; from here they ruled Indonesia for more than three centuries. Following the Japanese invasion and rule of the country from 1942-45, on August 17,1945, Indonesia's first president Soekarno, proclaimed Indonesian independence and Jakarta became the accepted nation's capital.",
